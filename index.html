  		<h3>About Me</h3>
  		<p>Before my job shadow at Uber5, I always thought of the IT industry as being a male-dominant, stressful environment with little room for creativity. After experiencing first-hand what the industry is like, I found it to be open, innovative and fun.

		<p>The experience of my job shadow at Uber5 was the complete opposite of what i expected. After spending two days of learning and coding in a comfortable environment, with friendly people and a great mentor, i found myself having fun. I worked my way through concepts foriegn to many but in the end, I found that there's really nothing you can't do. Right now, its at the top of my list.
